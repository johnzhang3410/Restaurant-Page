# Restaurant-Page
A web page built with interactive menus/logos and a responsive design for all users (mobile etc.)

Note that I have only built out the 'Home' page, as buiding other pages are quite repetitive and requires a lot of time (They are a lot of the same stuff)
Written using HTML and CSS.

All pictures will need to be put in a folder called 'images' (All jpg and png files except "image.png")
"contacts", "locations", and "menu" need to be put in a folder called "pages"
day4index.html and main.css are just in the general parent directory (../ of 'images' and 'pages' folders)

The file "images.png" is a screenshot of what the site looks like

Thanks for viewing :)
